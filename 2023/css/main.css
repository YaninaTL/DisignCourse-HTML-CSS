html {
  font-size: 62.5%;
}
/* = 10px
This technique is often used as a way to establish a consistent baseline font size for a web page. By using 10px as the base font size, it becomes easier to calculate font sizes in rem (root em) units. For example, if you want to set the font size of a specific element to 1.6rem, it will be equal to 16px (since 1rem is equal to the base font size).

By starting with a relative font size like 62.5%, you can maintain a flexible and consistent typography system that adjusts well to different devices and screen sizes while still allowing you to work with pixel-based measurements when needed.*/

  /* EM - based on the font size of the nearest parent element; allows for contextual sizing, where the size should be relative to the font size of a nearby element;adapt to changes in font size;
  !!! if we set a margin or padding to 1em, it will be equal to the font size of that parent element. */
